# show-me-your-code
In this small project, you will demonstrate your coding and reasoning skills on a real data set.

You will find all the necessary instructions in the `notebook.ipynb` file. To open this file, you must install _Jupyter lab_. To do so, we recommend installing [_Miniconda_](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Once installed, type `conda install jupyterlab` in your terminal.

To complete this project, we ask you to create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and to fork the [present repository](https://github.com/romainmartinez/show-me-your-code). Fill the file `notebook.ipynb` with your answers and send us the address of your repository (e.g. `https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/show-me-your-code`) before the deadline.

Please keep in mind that we will test your codes, it is therefore important that you update the `environment.yml` file with the python libraries you used to have a reproducible development environment.

Good luck!
